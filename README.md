# Fidget_Spinners
A Repository for the (hopefully limited) multitude of 3D-printed fidget spinners we create

Donut_Spinner - It's shaped like a donut for National Donut Day
Magnet_Spinner - Designed to accommodate 3 x .25" neodymium magnets
Spin_Grip - The part of the spinner that goes through the bearing so you can hold it
